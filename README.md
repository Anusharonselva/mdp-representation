# MDP REPRESENTATION

## AIM:
To represent an Elevator Control System using a Markov Decision Process (MDP)
## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
To create a Markov Decision Process (MDP) for an elevator system that moves between floors and serves passengers efficiently.
### Problem Description
To create an elevator system for a building with 4 floors.
The elevator can move, open/close doors, or stay idle.
Using MDP, we want to help the elevator serve passengers quickly and efficiently.### State Space
